//! Tendermint RPC definitions and types.
//!
//! ## Client
//!
//! This crate optionally provides access to different types of RPC client
//! functionality and different client transports based on which features you
//! select when using it.
//!
//! Two features are provided at present:
//!
//! * `http-client` - Provides [`HttpClient`], which is a basic RPC client that
//!   interacts with remote Tendermint nodes via **JSON-RPC over HTTP**. This
//!   client does not provide [`Event`] subscription functionality. See the
//!   [Tendermint RPC] for more details.
//! * `websocket-client` - Provides [`WebSocketClient`], which provides full
//!   client functionality, including general RPC functionality (such as that
//!   provided by `HttpClient`) as well as [`Event`] subscription
//!   functionality.
//!
//! ### Mock Clients
//!
//! Mock clients are included when either of the `http-client` or
//! `websocket-client` features are enabled to aid in testing. This includes
//! [`MockClient`], which implements both [`Client`] and [`SubscriptionClient`]
//! traits.
//!
//! [`Client`]: trait.Client.html
//! [`SubscriptionClient`]: trait.SubscriptionClient.html
//! [`HttpClient`]: struct.HttpClient.html
//! [`Event`]: event/struct.Event.html
//! [`WebSocketClient`]: struct.WebSocketClient.html
//! [Tendermint RPC]: https://docs.tendermint.com/master/rpc/
//! [`/subscribe` endpoint]: https://docs.tendermint.com/master/rpc/#/Websocket/subscribe
//! [`MockClient`]: struct.MockClient.html
